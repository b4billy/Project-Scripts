This is a collection of smaller projects or visualizations that I have created.

Three Point Contest Bootstrapping.R - This is a project I created in December 2021/January 2022 where I performed bootstrap resampling on Steph Curry's 3 Pointers in order to simulate the Three Point Contest. Here is a link to the small right up I did on Twitter: https://twitter.com/_b4billy_/status/1477390579118100485?s=20

Biscuits Playoffs 2021 Folder - These are a few visualizations I did during October 2021 about the AA Tampa Affiliate Montgomery Biscuits and their championship drought.
