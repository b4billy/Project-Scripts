# Project Scripts
This is a collection of project scripts. These include larger projects such as my Biathlon K-Means Clustering project and the Three Point Contest Bootstrapping as well as quick fun ones such as visualizations for the Montgomery Biscuits. I will be updating this README File soon with information as to what exactly each file in here is.
